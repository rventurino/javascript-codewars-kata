    <h3>A square of squares</h3>
    <p>
      You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are
      squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of
      square building blocks!
      <br /> <br />
      However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end
      up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way
      to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait! That's it! You
      just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
    </p>
    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:</p>
    <span
      ><i
        >In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is
        the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some
        integer with itself.</i
      ></span
    >
    <p>
      The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that
      in dynamic typed languages.
    </p>
    <div class="grid">
      <div>
      <h3>Solution:</h3>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">

          var isSquare = function(n){
              if(n===0){
                return true;
              }
                if(n>0){
                  let sr = Math.sqrt(n)
                  let sqMult = sr*sr
                  if(n%sr === 0){
                    return true
                  }
            
                }
                return false; // fix me
              }
