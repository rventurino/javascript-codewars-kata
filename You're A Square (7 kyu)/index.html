    <h3>A square of squares</h3>
    <p>
      You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are
      squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of
      square building blocks!
      <br />
      However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end
      up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way
      to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You
      just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
    </p>
    <h3>Task</h3>
    <p>Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:</p>
    <span
      ><i
        >In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is
        the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some
        integer with itself.</i
      ></span
    >
    <p>
      The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that
      in dynamic typed languages.
    </p>
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-html">

      const output = document.getElementById('output')

        var isSquare = function(n){
            if(n===0){
              return true;
            }
              if(n>0){
                let sr = Math.sqrt(n)
                let sqMult = sr*sr
                if(n%sr === 0){
                  return true
                }
          
              }
              return false; // fix me
            }

    </pre>
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <div id="output"></div>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
